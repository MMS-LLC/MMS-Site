      <h2>Our Offerings</h2>
      <ul class="offerings-list">
        <li><strong>Ultrasound Equipment</strong> – We trust the SonoSite mTurbo and similar portable systems for their durability and image clarity. These units are perfect for maternal health, emergency diagnostics, and routine screenings in remote locations. Please <a href="contact.html" style="color:#FFD700; text-decoration:underline;">contact us</a> for a friendly conversation about how we can help meet your ultrasound needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Endoscopy Systems &amp; Scopes</strong> – Our selection includes the Olympus GIF-160 endoscopy system and a variety of interchangeable scopes designed for gastrointestinal and ENT procedures. These compact and rugged units are ideal for mission clinics seeking reliable visualization tools without excessive bulk.</li>
        <li><strong>EKG Machines</strong> – We offer easy-to-use EKG devices such as the Zoll M Series, which are pre-tested and calibrated to ensure accurate readings wherever you serve. These machines are designed for field conditions and minimal maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>X-ray Units</strong> – Our portable X-ray machines, including models like the MinXray HF100/200, come with digital imaging panels and are engineered for low-power operation and simple setup. They can be deployed quickly in field hospitals or rural clinics, bringing essential radiography to areas without fixed infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All our offerings emphasize portability, straightforward setup, and minimal maintenance. We believe in sharing our expertise—not pushing sales—so you get exactly what you need to serve your community effectively.</p>

      <h1>Empowering Healthcare in Remote Regions</h1>
      <p>Med Mission Supplies partners with hospitals, rural clinics, and mission projects across the USA and Africa. Our mission is to connect resource-limited healthcare providers with essential medical technologies while minimizing costs. We achieve this by reducing overhead, negotiating bulk discounts, and leveraging refurbished equipment to pass the lowest possible prices directly to overseas clinics.</p>
      <ul class="overview-list">
        <li><strong>Durable medical imaging systems</strong>: From portable ultrasound machines like the SonoSite mTurbo to handheld Doppler devices, our imaging solutions are built to withstand extreme environments and deliver reliable diagnostics.</li>
        <li><strong>Refurbished diagnostic &amp; therapeutic equipment</strong>: We rigorously restore vital equipment—such as patient monitors, infusion pumps, and defibrillators—to OEM standards, ensuring quality at a fraction of the original cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Global shipping &amp; customs coordination</strong>: Our logistics team handles international freight, customs clearance, and last-mile delivery, so clinics receive equipment quickly without unexpected fees.</li>
        <li><strong>On-site training and technical support</strong>: We provide hands-on workshops for clinicians and biomedical technicians, plus remote troubleshooting, so equipment remains operational long-term.</li>
        <li><strong>Supply chain consulting &amp; logistics</strong>: By analyzing local needs and purchasing trends, we help clinics optimize inventory, reduce waste, and forecast future requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By focusing on cost-efficiency and strategic sourcing, Med Mission Supplies ensures that healthcare providers in underserved regions get access to top-tier technology at the best possible price. Whether delivering a portable ultrasound for maternal health or supplying refurbished ventilators for emergency response, we empower clinicians to deliver quality care without financial strain.</p>

      <h2>About Med Mission Supplies</h2>
      <p>For over a decade, Med Mission Supplies has partnered with humanitarian organizations, rural clinics, and mission hospitals across sub-Saharan Africa and underserved regions of the United States. We source, refurbish, and distribute durable medical equipment—including portable ultrasound machines, diagnostic monitors, and surgical tools—to environments that lack reliable infrastructure. By collaborating with local healthcare leaders and international NGOs, our team ensures that each shipment addresses critical needs such as maternal health, emergency response, and chronic disease management.</p>
      <p>Our approach goes beyond equipment delivery: we provide hands-on training for clinicians, technicians, and community health workers to maintain and operate devices long-term. Through ongoing remote support, technical troubleshooting, and supply chain consulting, we empower local partners to build self-sustaining healthcare solutions. Guided by principles of equity and sustainability, Med Mission Supplies delivers cost-effective, field-tested solutions that save lives and strengthen health systems where resources are scarce.</p>
